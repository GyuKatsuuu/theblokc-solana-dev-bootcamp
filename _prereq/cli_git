Why should you learn CLI
- Most learning tools run on CLI e.g pip for Python
- Fast navigation
- More freedom and control (though mag ingat parin)

Basic CLI Commands:
pwd (To print the current working directory)
ls (To list the information on that directory)
ls -a (A more extensive list)
ls -a -l (All and Long List that includes hidden files)
cd (changes directory)
mkrdir (makes a directory)
rm (removes files / directories)
